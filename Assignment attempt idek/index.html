        <div class="tea-plantations-description">
        <div class="tea-plantations-text">
            <p>The elevations of high-grown Ceylon teas range from 400 to 6000 feet above sea level.
            Due to the constant cool and windy climate, these teas, which account for the majority of Ceylon's tea production, have a stronger aroma compared to others and are lighter in flavor and color.
            Nuwara Eliya, Uda Pussellawa and Dimbulla are the main high-grown tea regions of the country.</p>

        <h1>Ceylon's mid-grown tea plantations</h1>
        <div class="tea-plantations-description">
        <div class="tea-plantations-text">
            <p>Sri Lankan mid-grown teas are primarily found in and around the Kandy district, at elevations of around 2000 feet.
                They have a rich flavor, a medium body, and a brisk, light taste.
                Mid-grown teas are distinguished by their bright burgundy color. The peak season for growth of these teas is in the spring, but unlike high and low-growngrown teas, these bushes grow all year due to the low monsoon impact. 
                Mid-grown teas are commonly found in the Central and Uva provinces of Sri Lanka.</p>

        <h1>Ceylon's low-grown tea plantations</h1>
        <div class="tea-plantations-description">
        <div class="tea-plantations-text">
            <p>Low-grown teas account for the majority of Ceylon tea production and are also the fastest growing.
                The teas are grown at a height of about 300 feet above sea level. They have a distinct dark color and strong flavor due to the region's extreme heat and humidity levels.
                You can find tea plantations that belong to the low-grown tea category in the Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces of Sri Lanka.</p>

        <p>Situated around four kilometres to the south of Kandy, the Ceylon Tea Museum occupies a building that was once the Hatane Tea Factory, constructed in 1925. The tea factory had been abandoned for over a decade before the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Clifford Ratwatte, incorporated the Ceylon Tea Museum into it in 1998. The Tea Board and the Planters’ Association of Sri Lanka ensured that the building was refurbished for its new designation as a museum, and it was formally opened to the public on the 1st of December in 2001.</p>

            <p>Brilliant!
                If you want to learn a bit about the history of tea in Sri Lanka this is a great place to visit. Lots of wonderful old machinery and all sorts of interesting displays. Fascinating and well worth a visit!</p>

            <p>Interesting and worth seeing
                After a lot of Temples and relics it was interesting to see the history of tea and the way it is dried and sorted and graded - worth visiting and fun to have tea in their shop and of course buy tea!</p>

            <p>Not to be missed!
                This quiet museum is a hidden gem!! Absolutely underrated by guide books! It was fascinating to see traditional tea making equipment, and learn the history. Our entrance fee included a complementary guide who was professional and spoke excellent English. We finished with a delicious cup of tea in the café overlooking great views, and buying different types of tea from the shop for our friends and family.</p>
